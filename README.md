# Introduction to R: One Day Workshop
# Workshop Materials

* Download workshop materials and unzip them to a folder on your computer:
  https://github.com/jeromyanglim/acpid-2019-rtraining/archive/master.zip
* If you are on Windows, make sure that you actually unzipped the file. Windows allows you to navigate within zip files without actually unzipping them. This causes problems. It's important that you actually unzip the file.

# Install R and R Studio
These instructions assume that you have already installed R and RStudio.
If you have not already done this, go to the following sites.

* R: http://cran.rstudio.com/
* Rstudio Desktop: http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/


* If you are on Windows, you will probably need to install rtools: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

# Install Additional R Packages
Open R Studio and paste the following text into the console. This should take
a few minutes to complete. Don't worry if the odd package doesn't 
install.

    install.packages("knitr")
    install.packages("ProjectTemplate")
    install.packages("MASS")
